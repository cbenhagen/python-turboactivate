# Python integration for TurboActivate

Python integration for [LimeLM's](https://wyday.com/limelm/) [TurboActivate library](https://wyday.com/limelm/help/using-turboactivate/). This lets you add hardware-locked licensing (a.k.a. node-locked licensing) to your Python app.

Development status: **stable**.


## Installation

**Note**: this branch is not currently in PyPi. It's a separate, official, development from wyDay (the creators of LimeLM and TurboActivate) based on the intial (fantastic) work by devler. However, if you install turboactivate from PyPi (via `pip install ...`) then you will be getting an outdated version.

We're working with devler to get our version in PyPi so this confusion will end soon.

In the meantime, to use our version of the TurboActivate class, download it from here (or from [your LimeLM API page](https://wyday.com/limelm/api/#turboactivate)).


## Usage

We have a full example app and tutorial here: [Using TurboActivate with Python](https://wyday.com/limelm/help/using-turboactivate-with-python/)
